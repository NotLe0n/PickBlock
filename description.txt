Middle click a tile to get or select its item! Works for most tiles and walls and even modded ones!
You can also set a setting in the config to give you the item if you don't have it.

If you have any problems, bugs, or suggestions contact me on my discord: https://discord.gg/NX4DVzz2v6

Special thanks to Gin for making the icon.
